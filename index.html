    <p>My name is Aidrin Morris, I'm working towards becoming a tech support
       specialist. I've kind of fallen off the technical train and have been thinking
       of switching up to something different, but am currently torn on what. I've
       been doing online school as I live in the middle of nowhere and the nearest
       campus is over two hours away. (The picture of me in glasses was taken on a
       flip phone and then upscaled.)</p>
    <p>I have lots of hobbies and would call myself a jack of all trades in a sense.
       I'll do practically anything. Here's an uncompleted list of things I do.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="description-box">
    <h2>Some of the things I like to do:</h2>
    <p>I love the creative arts. I make music, write my own stories, and paint/draw.</p>
    <p>I collect old things, either by metal detecting or antiquing.</p>
    <p>I build my own computers, I have built three so far. Working on a fourth.</p>
    <p>I love listening to music. I listen to practically everything, from digital hardcore to jazz.</p>
    <p>I like to watch and read anime/manga in my free time. Some of my favorite anime/manga are <strong>Knights of Sidonia,</strong> <strong>Neon Genesis Evangelion,</strong> and <strong>Ghost in the Shell.</strong></p>
    <p>I enjoy playing <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> and <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong> with my friends.
       The high school I went to has game nights on Monday, which I attend regularly.
       I also make custom <strong>MTG</strong> cards.</p>
    <p>I love driving and working on cars. If the gas and car/part prices weren't so high,
       I would drive and work on cars more often.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="description-box">
    <p>The next page I will focus on my favorite anime/manga, as I have recently been really into these lately.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="user">
    <p>I'm pretty shy, but I'm trying to push myself to talk to more people. Living in the middle of nowhere doesn't help though, so I usually do everything online. If you maybe wanted to talk to me about anything I mainly use <strong>Discord</strong>. My username is tizerofthesanann or my id: 1253912376588107868</p>
